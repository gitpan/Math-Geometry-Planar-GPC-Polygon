      my $gpc = Math::Geometry::Planar::GPC::Polygon->new();

  new_gpc

    An optionally imported constructor, for those of you who don't like to
    type so much.

      use Math::Geometry::Planar::GPC::Polygon qw(new_gpc);
      my $gpc = new_gpc();

    These are the functions provide by the Inline-C code.

    Need to document these.
